# Signature Detection & Compliance Checker

A modular compliance checking tool for government acquisition documents, focusing on automated signature detection and validation.

## 🎉 Project Setup Complete!

I've created a complete, modular signature detection and compliance checking system with the following structure:

```

### 🚀 **Key Features Implemented**

1. **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with dedicated modules for each component
2. **Multi-Engine OCR**: Support for PaddleOCR, Tesseract, and EasyOCR
3. **YOLO Integration**: Ready for custom signature detection models
4. **Compliance Matrix**: Configurable document types and required signatures
5. **CLI Interface**: Easy-to-use command-line tools
6. **Comprehensive Configuration**: YAML-based configuration system
7. **Quality Validation**: Signature quality and confidence assessment
8. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple documents efficiently

### 🛠 **Ready-to-Use Commands**

```bash
# Setup environment
python scripts/setup_environment.py

# Detect signatures
python run.py detect path/to/document.pdf

# Check compliance
python run.py check path/to/document.pdf

# Batch processing
python run.py batch path/to/pdf/directory/

# System info
python run.py info
```

### 📋 **Next Steps for You**

1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `python scripts/setup_environment.py`
2. **Add Your Documents**: Place PDFs in `data/raw/`
3. **Configure Settings**: Edit `config/config.yaml` as needed
4. **Test the System**: Use the example commands above
5. **Prepare Training Data**: When you get your sample documents, use LabelImg or Roboflow for annotation

### 🔧 **Technical Highlights**

- **PDF Processing**: PyMuPDF + pdf2image with preprocessing (deskew, denoise, contrast enhancement)
- **OCR Flexibility**: Multiple engines with fallback options
- **Compliance Logic**: Rule-based validation with role mapping
- **Quality Assessment**: Confidence scoring and issue detection
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new document types and signature requirements

The system is designed to be production-ready and can handle the government acquisition document requirements you specified. Once you have access to your sample documents, you'll be able to:

1. Annotate signature examples for training
2. Train a custom YOLO model
3. Fine-tune the compliance matrix
4. Deploy the system for automated compliance checking
